# C64FileTest
Trying to get file loading from asm working

From command line I run  ./d.cmd in this folder.  I can seem to either build & run the load_assets.asm
OR the disk1.d64 but not both??

If I run LOAD"HIRED",8 and RUN it launches and you can see the screen flash that it's working, but I
can't figure out how to make it just run automatically... Even passing -autorundisk option to c64debug 
doesn't seem to make a difference.
